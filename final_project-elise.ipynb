    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is to map the flood events in the Philippines ranging from year 2000 to 2018. The Philippines is a series of thousands of islands in Southeast Asia with multiple climates such as tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical and oceanic. The country is exposed to many earthquakes on a daily basis and is surrounded by many active volcanos. Climate change has led to more extreme weather patterns including heavier rainfall and storm surges. A series of tropical storms over the years have led to mass destruction and loss of human life. \n"

    "\n",
    "The Global Food Database was created by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) and Cloud to Street with the intent of being utilized for global flood risk management and mitigation. This ImageCollection was funded by Google Earth Outreach, and includes 18 years (2000-2018) of satellite-based flood data available on Google Earth Engine. The dataset includes 913 flood events using 12,719 scenes that that were successfully mapped to include the extent and temporal distribution using Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors. Each of the events are represented as an image in the ImageCollection and can be filtered by date, country, and DFO “original ID”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes many image properties such as estimated fatalities, country code, main cause of flood, the centroid longitude and latitude, among others. An interesting image property that the visualizations will focus on is the severity of a flood event. It is broken down into 3 categories; 1 represents large floods that had significant damage and at least a 5-to-15-year interval since the last large flood, 1.5 is assigned to very large events with greater than 15 years but less than 100 year recurrence interval, and 2 denotes extreme events that have a recurrence interval of more than 100 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bands in the dataset include duration of flood along with a value of 0 or 1 to represent whether or not there was a flood event. Data on cloud coverage is displayed as the number of cloud-free observations in days between the start and end day of each event. In addition, cloud coverage has been assigned a percentage of clear view observations during a given flood event.\n",

    " - Create an _environment_ file: this is a text file which contains information on the packages needed in order to execute your code. The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",
